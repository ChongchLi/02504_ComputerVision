## Learning Objective
After this lecture you should be able to:

### 1.explain the phenomelogical origin of lens distortion
> Lens distortion occurs due to the fact that the image formed by a lens does not perfectly match the ideal mathematical image. This is because light rays passing through the edges of a lens are bent more than those passing through the center, which causes the image to be distorted. There are two types of lens distortion, barrel distortion and pincushion distortion.

### 2.compensate for lens distortion in images
> There are various methods to compensate for lens distortion in images, including using correction algorithms based on polynomial models of the distortion, using look-up tables, or using machine learning methods. One common method is to model the distortion using a radial distortion model, where the distortion is represented as a polynomial function of the distance from the center of the image. This polynomial can then be inverted to correct the distorted image.

### 3.explain the phenomelogical origin of the pinhole camera parameters
> The pinhole camera parameters describe the geometric relationship between the world coordinate system and the camera coordinate system. These parameters include the intrinsic parameters, such as the focal length and principal point, and the extrinsic parameters, such as the camera orientation and position. The intrinsic parameters describe the mapping between the image plane and the world coordinate system, while the extrinsic parameters describe the location and orientation of the camera in the world.

### 4.derive the homography matrix

### 5.explain the use of homographies in computer vision

### 6.perform the linear estimation of a homography matrix

### 7.use singular value decomposition (SVD) to solve linear systems
